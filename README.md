# Welcome to my Lab 4 page.

# Lab 4 consisted of:
- Creating initial Fastify Node.js web server
- Initializing as a Node.js project folder using Node Package Manager (npm)
- Adding Fastify to project using npm, and test using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Adding git repo, exclude node_modules folder from git, make commits
- Fixing MIME error, test, and commit
- Adding a second route with query parameters, test, and commit
- (deliverable for project 3)

## What I learned:
- I learned how to initialize a Fastify node.js web server AND initialize a node.js project folder using Node Package Manager or 'npm'
- I learned how to add fastify to a project using npm
- I learned how to add a git repo while excluding node_modules from git
- I learned what MIME errors are and how to fix, test, and commit them
- I learned how to add a second route with query parameters
